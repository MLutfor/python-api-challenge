The python script for the WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb programs are based on the codes provided by the in-class assignments from the U of T Data Analysis bootcamp. 
ChaGPT was also used in the assistance of debugging and refactoring the script.

The main purpose of WeatherPy is to find any correlation between latitude and other factors such as temperature, humidity,
and cloudiness.

The main purpose of VacationPy is to help plan future vacations.  This is done by finding random cities to visit, and 
plotting them on an interactive map.  The size of their plots will be determined based on the city's humidity.  There will be an api request 
to geoapify to find nearest hotels for these cities.  The hotel names will be updated into a new map.
